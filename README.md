# Patterns-of-Democracy (R)

## Project Overview 

### Motivating Question

In this project I examine whether consensus democracy - a form of democracy characterized by political scientist Arend Lijphart - improves economic outcomes. 

Consensus democracy is one of the two types of democracy Lijphart (2012) identifies, with the other one being majoritarian democracy. The distinction between the two relies on competing views of democracy. Majoritarian democracies exemplify the view that the will of the majority should rule, while the aim of consensus democracies is to include the views of as many citizens as possible. 

To test whether consensus democracy improves economic outcomes, I use Lijphart’s data from 36 democracies to look at the relationship between the countries’ scores on the executive-parties index and economic outcomes.

## Key Results and Insights 

* Out of selected economic measures, the type of democracy only makes a significant difference when it comes to unemployment.
* Consensus democracy decreases unemployment
* Interest group corporatism is the main driver of the relationship between consensus democracy and unemployment. Corporatism being the main driver of the effect on unemployment might cause doubt on the role of consensus democracy more broadly, as Lijphart points out that “there is no clear causal connection that links it [interest group corporatism] to the other variables [making up consensus democracy]” (Lijphart, p.70)

## Code and Resources Used 
**R Version:** 4.0 
**Theoretical Background:** Patterns of Democracy, Arend Lijphart (2012)

## Exploratory Analysis 

* the countries with populations smaller than 0.5 million (i.e. the Bahamas, Barbados, Iceland, Luxembourg and Malta) have been excluded from the analysis since their economies are likely strongly influenced by international economic forces.  
* countries with missing data are also excluded from the analysis
